### Go and Solid Boilerplate

NOTE: This repo uses Typescript so if you are looking for Javascript, this is not for you... or you can just convert it.

This can be used with both the front end and the backend on the server or both separate.

The backend uses golang with fiber at the http server to serve the API endpoints and gorm for DB access.

The front end uses Solid with Typescript.

I might eventually make another branch with Tailwind.
